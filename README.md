## 💡 About Me


Hi, I’m Manish — a data enthusiast with a philosopher’s mindset and an analyst’s toolkit.
I began my journey exploring the depths of human thought, logic, and reasoning through Philosophy at Delhi University. That intellectual curiosity led me to IIT, where I mastered the art of turning data into decisions through Data Analytics & Decision Science.

A thinker by heart and an analyst by profession — I blend the depth of philosophy with the precision of data.  
From understanding abstract human reasoning to uncovering insights in structured data, my journey has been about asking the right questions and finding meaningful answers.
